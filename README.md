Project Name
A/B Test Plan: Swag Checkout Optimization & Post-MVP Scaling

Description
This project outlines a strategic A/B testing plan designed to optimize and scale the conversion lift achieved by the initial T-Shirt Checkout MVP. The primary objective is to drive continuous improvement in the user experience and conversion rates through rapid, in-production experimentation.

Key Contributions & Features:

Comprehensive Test Matrix: Developed a detailed A/B test matrix, specifying multiple experiments focused on critical checkout touchpoints. Each test includes:

Unique Test ID: For clear tracking and reference.

Descriptive Test Name: Clearly defines the area of experimentation (e.g., "Order-Summary Placement," "Error-Message Tone").

Defined Variants (A & B): Outlines the specific UI/UX or copy changes being tested (e.g., "Sidebar sticky" vs. "Inline collapsible panel," "Concise technical copy" vs. "Friendly / supportive copy").

Primary Metric: Identifies the key performance indicator (KPI) for success (e.g., "Checkout Conversion %," "Payment-Retry Success %").

Assigned Owner: Specifies the responsible team or role.

Contextual Notes/Hunch: Provides rationale or expected outcomes for each test.

Interactive Error Message Tone Demo (AB-004): Integrated a clickable, side-by-side prototype within the plan itself to visually demonstrate the "Error-Message Tone" A/B test. This interactive element showcases the difference between technical and friendly error messaging, highlighting the progressive escalation of support options (e.g., "Chat with support") after multiple failed attempts.

Robust Execution Framework: Defined the operational parameters for conducting the A/B tests, including:

Tooling: Recommendation for platforms like Optimizely or internal variant services.

Segmentation: Strategy for randomized 50/50 split with secondary analysis for power-users.

Statistical Confidence: Target for reliable results (95% two-tailed).

Sample Size & Duration: Estimated requirements for achieving statistical significance based on traffic.

Strategic Optimization Focus: The plan strategically targets areas identified for potential conversion gains, such as layout, call-to-action hierarchy, trust signals, and critical user feedback (error messages).

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS for rapid styling), JavaScript (Vanilla JS for interactive demo logic and modal functionality).

Tools/Concepts: Git/GitHub for version control, A/B Testing Methodologies, User Experience (UX) Research, Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), Data-Driven Decision Making.

Impact & Learning Outcomes:

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of post-launch product optimization and data-driven design. It showcases the ability to structure complex experimentation plans, define measurable metrics, and anticipate user behavior through variant testing. Developing the interactive demo further highlights practical skills in implementing UX/UI concepts for testing purposes. This work reinforces the importance of continuous iteration and quantitative analysis in product development, building upon the foundational MVP.

Media Examples to Add
To make your LinkedIn project stand out, consider adding the following:

Link to Live Demo:

Provide the direct URL to your GitHub Pages site where this A/B Test Plan is hosted (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/your-ab-test-repo/). This allows recruiters to interact with the plan directly.

Link to GitHub Repository:

Include the link to your project's GitHub repository so others can review your code and project structure.

Screenshots:

Full A/B Test Matrix: A screenshot showing the entire table with all test IDs, names, variants, and metrics.

Execution Framework Section: A clear shot of the "Execution Framework" section.

AB-004 Summary Modal: A screenshot of the small modal that appears when "AB-004" is clicked, showing the overview of the error message tone test.

AB-004 Interactive Demo Modal (Multiple Shots):

A shot of the demo modal open, showing "Step 1" with Variant A and B descriptions.

A shot showing a later step (e.g., "Step 3" or "Step 4") to illustrate the progressive messaging.

Optional: If possible, show a side-by-side comparison of the actual checkout prototype (from your other project) demonstrating the different error message tones as described in the A/B test plan.

Short Video Demo (Highly Recommended):

Record a brief (1-2 minute) video.

Start by showing the full A/B test matrix table.

Then, click on the "AB-004" row to open the summary modal.

Click "See example flow" to open the interactive demo modal.

Walk through the steps of the interactive demo (clicking "Next") to showcase the progressive error messages for Variant B.

Briefly open the linked variant prototypes (Variant A and Variant B) in new tabs (if they are live) to show the actual implementation of the error messages.

This video will dynamically showcase your understanding of both planning and demonstrating UX experiments.
